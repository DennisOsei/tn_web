# GeoJSON

The GeoJSON spec v1.1 is available on [github](https://gist.github.com/virtualandy/1233401).
There's also the [geojson.org](https://geojson.org/) website, which is
a bit more up-to-date and notes that an IETF WG to standardise
GeoJSON, resulting in [RFC
7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).

JSON itself is specified in [RFC 4627](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

# Software

A somewhat useful python library for manipulating GeoJSON is
[geojson](https://geojson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

On the django side,
[django-geojson](https://django-geojson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
provides several views using Leaflet.  (Interesting aside: it's
copyright Makina Corpus.)
